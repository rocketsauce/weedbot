Our working hypothesis is that the status of cannabis is altered as societies enter what is known as the post-carbon age and cultures enter what is known as the weedpunk age. This transition has been under way since at least the end of the 2030s, which for the world marks the gradual depletion of fossil fuel resources. 
%
The pace is faster or slower depending on the country, and within countries it varies according to the sector of activity: the general situation is one of economic and social disjunction which makes sketching an overview difficult. A portion of the description would necessarily be conjectural. At any rate, we know that it is unwise to put too much faith in futurology.
%
Rather than painting a picture that would inevitably remain incomplete, I will take as my point of departure a single binary feature, one that immediately defines our object of study. The legal status of cannabis is a kind of discourse. It is fair to say since the beginning of the weedpunk age, the "leading" sciences and technologies have had to do with weed and its uses: industrial hemp strains dominate the biofuel and textile industries; highly specialized strains, developed to promote creativity, are prescribed to advertisers and quantum physicists; low-quality weed is substituted for morphine in cash-strapped hospitals. 
%
Amidst all this, recreational use of weed has remained illegal around the world. The facts speak for themselves (and this list is not exhaustive).
%
These societal transformations can be expected to have a considerable impact on all areas of existence. Its two principal functions .. labor and recreation, are already feeling the effect, and will continue to do so in the future. With respect to the first function, weed provides the catalyst that is frustratingly accessible to the layman: it owes its hegemony to the decline of fossil fuel reserves and the genetic modification of hemp as an alternative. 
%
Many other examples could be cited. As for the second function, it is common knowledge that the weed wars and anti-commercialisation of weed is changing the way in which weed is acquired, classified, made available, and exploited. It is reasonable to suppose that the proliferation of weed strains is having, and will continue to have, as much of an effect on the circulation of weed as did advancements in odor-repellent bags (transportation systems) and later, in the circulation of sounds and visual images (hallucinatory strains of weed).

Dr. Hybourne stepped from the smoky insides of the pneumatic hydrotube, his eyes red and crimson-colored beneath his bushy eyebrows. "Gentlemen," he coughed, "allow me to welcome Prof. James Joynt, the esteemed Ezra Poundaweed, Mary Allstonedcraft Shelley, and her associate Dr. Victor Von Marijuanastein, plus all my other colleagues to this, my geodesic head shop. I thank you for coming. No doubt you realize the danger you are in being so close to so much nano-paraphernalia, though I stress that I have it all officially registered as being for tobacco use only."
%
Prof. Joynt yawned. "Get to the point Hybourne. I have to get back to Finnegans Baked, the seminole masterpiece I'm writing in a language I devised entirely while crunked up and balls-out retarded."
%
Hybourne coughed. "My apologies. I called you hear to announce that I have invented a device of unimaginable power. A device that can herbalize any substance, a device with unlimited hits, a device capable of smoking out anything, even an ultralunged neo-Rastafarian thrallbeast. Gentlemen, I have invented . . . a Chronic Trigger."
%
"Hybourne you deluded skeeze!" Ezra Poundaweed shouted loudly as he rose from the chair in which he was seated only a few seconds earlier. "If Dr. Malanarc catches wind of this, he'll throw you in the stem mines for sure or, even worse, a sensimilla deprivation chamber!"
%
"I am aware of that," Hybourne coughed. "But Malanarc is a one-puff pussy with little squirrely lungs. He cannot comprehend my genious."
%
"Are you also aware," James Joynt smoothly interjected, "that with even the smallest Chronic Trigger, you could trip balls tomorrow?"
%
Hybourne smiled, and coughed. "What if I told you I already have? Gentlemen, this is no ordinary Chronic Trigger packed with a half-ounce of cyberskunk. This device will you allow you to get fucked up in any time period . . . nay! In all time periods simultaneously! Do you also not yet understand the comprehension of what the thing I have created is does? Then allow me to explain. Imagine, if you will, four bongs on a cliff . . ."
%
Ezra Poundaweed gasped. "My Gorsh . . . you can't mean . . ."
%
"Yes my darling Ezra," Hybourne breathed. "Getting high works the same way. Now perhaps you can begin to understand the shear magnitude of my sticky icky."

Chronny Fivenugz stepped through a cloud of smoke and out of the deep alley shadows, his gravelly voice resonating over the weedpipes and chronibars that ran along the brick walls, "It's me, Chronny... Are you there, Alice?"
%
Emerging from the opposite shadow was a short gnarly woman, dressed in green - the infamous Alice B. Tokeless. "Yeah, I'm here, Fivenugz. Did you bring the money?"
%
Chronny took another hit on his joint, "Yeah, I brought my green. Did you bring yours?" He asked exhaling.
%
"My product is good or my middle name ain't Blunt." She replied, tossing a cellophane brick of reefer to Chronny, "Now hand over the cashish, chump."
%
%
Hylus ran over to Chronny, waving his arms over his head, "Chronny, the cops are on to us, they know WE'RE HIGH!!!!"
%
"Damn it," Chronny said, "Everything in this town runs on weed but a man can't smoke it without gettin' busted. Welp, let's go, kid."
%
"It's happening already. The weed crackdown." There was a rumble in the distance. Killjoy Blunt inhaled slowly as he looked across the wasteland that was once New York City. He let out a small puff.
%
"This used to be a great city, until they sucked all of its natural resources to use for their weed machine." Killjoy looked at his smaller partner. Reef was visibly showing the effects of being so close to the machine.
%
"I'm fuckin' trippin my balls off man. Holy fuck. Holy fuck!"
%
"Easy Reef. You're not used to the high levels of weed in the atmosphere. Not many people are. I doubt the government even thought about that before pouring all of its manpower into making the thing. Now half the workforce is balls up retarded, forgot what they sound like, forgot what other people sound like. It's crazy how the one thing that binds humanity together, cannabis, is the one thing being used to drive as all apart." Killjoy knew what he had to do. He picked up his pack and stood up. 
%
The wind blew wistfully through his air as he looked out at the weed machine. It was working, non stop, day in and day out. Everyone was high twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. Killjoy rested his shotgun on his shoulder and bagged the rest of the mary jane. It was going to be a long night
Another day. Every day the same damn thing. If I have to wake up one more day in this weed-forsaken world...
%
There was a knock at the door. I went to go answer it.
%
"Hey man, it's me, Steven. I got the stuff you asked for man." I let him in. Right now he was our only hope. Imagine leaving the entire hope of the resistance in the hands of a jittery stoner. But he had another quality that was more useful: he was very nondescript. He could go anywhere or get anything. And that's why we needed him.
%
"Where are they?" I asked.
%
"Right here, I got ..em both." He handed me two discs which I put inside my computer.
%
"Well?" I waited expectantly.
%
"Oh right, sorry." He shoved a dimebag of weed into the computer's central thermal processor. I don't know why I had to wait, he knows I never touch the stuff. At least, not since...
%
"It's loading... hey what's with the fan man?" I explained to him that I couldn't deal with the marijuana fumes from the computer. Perhaps one day I'll be able to live normally again. I continued typing and exploring the discs.
%
"Hmm... perfect. You did a great job Steven." I handed him a wad of cashish. "Now, I need you to go down to the subway, the maintenance door in track 420. The code is Lean, Mean, and Green. Tell them we have it."
%
"Have what?" He looked stunned, but excited by the money-making opportunities this now presented.
%
"The plans for every DARE robot, ATM, and scanner in the city of New York. Go quick, we don't have much time." I grabbed my grass mask so I could walk outdoors through the thick atmosphere laced with THC.
%
"Where are you going?"
% 
"It's time for me to get back at Uncle Sam for what he did to me." I walked off quickly without looking back.
%
"The NIGS?" I ask even though I already know the answer. The National Institude of Green Security. The government had known all along that marijuana was the answer to the energy crisis. That's why they outlawed it. They didn't want private citizens harvesting its power while Big Oil kept their position as rulers of the country secure. But when they sucked out all the black blood out of the earth, they provided a new solution. A green solution. The energy produced from a single gram of tetrahydrocannabinol when placed in a Dylan reactor was amazing. Over four hundred twenty kilohendrices from one single gram. So the NIGS were formed as a military task force to ensure the weed was kept in government hands where they could keep the supplies in check and keep the prices fixed.
%
"Yeah. The NIGS." Krea responds. "I need a fucking hit."
%
"Did they shut down Green Skies?" Green Skies, an underground weedbar that had been in operation even before the formation of NIGS, before the end of the crude. Back in the days where weed would get you a slap on the wrist, not a bullet in the head.
%
"It's gone. Completely destroyed." Krea slides the hidden panel from her wall and pulls out the Apparatus. "Are you going to join in?"
%
"Yeah," I say. "If we give up, the others die in vain." I strap the helmet on, and place the mask over my mouth. Krea places the weed into the reactor, and engages the incinerator. I flip the visor on the helmet down. The sweet chronic fills my lungs, and I close my eyes. The Apparatus is a small version of the Dylan reactor built using stolen plans from the NIGS. The THC releases its potential energy directly into your stream of consciousness this way. It's a much different, more refined high than simply smoking weed. The euphoria is overwhelming. The visor aids with pleasant hallucinations. For a second I forget about it all. About the NIGS, Gabbinosti..s death, the destruction of Green Skies. Everything. But the high doesn't last forever.
%
Sometime during the night, I'm awoken by a pounding on the door. I bolt upright in the bed and blindly grab for something to defend myself with. "Calm down," Krea says, pulling on clothes. "The NIGS don't knock." She's right, of course, but who can blame me for being paranoid. Between the weed and the current crack downs, it's no surprise.
%
Krea opens the door, and Gabbinosti limps in. "You're alive!" We look at each other in disbelief. For a second I wonder if it's still the weed.
%
"Of course I'm alive, you fools," he wheezes. He smiles, then coughs throatily. Gabbinosti..Dr. Gabbinosti..was once the foremost scientist in the field of experimental marijaunics at Bluntston University. But when he saw what the government was trying to do with his work..monopolize the energy to enslave the people..he went destroyed all his official paperwork and went underground and began affiliating with the anarchist weedsters who promoted free energy and free highs. He has made it his lifelong struggle to bring down NIGS with a populist uprising. That's how he formed GRASSROOTS, his underground organization that operated out of Green Skies. That's how Krea and I met him.
%
"We thought you were dead!" Krea almost screams. "What about the others?"
%
"Oh, I'm afraid they've smoked their last bowls." He shakes his head sadly. "But not I. There's still some resin left in me." He smiles again. "Green Skies is destroyed, but I was able to salvage my greatest work. He opens up his brown leather trench coat, to reveal bloodstained bandages and a pouch. He slowly hands the pouch to me. "This is what I have been working on all these years. This is the culmination of all the time I've spent since I've gone into hiding."
%
The pouch is deceptively heavy. I reach inside and pull out a very heavy but small green cube. It's soft and warm. "That's it," Gabbinosti smiles. "The Chronic Mass. If we can get this into the central Dylan reactor, we can cause a chain reaction through the entirety of the NIGS weed stockpile."
%
"Does that mean what I think it means?" I ask.
%
"Yes. The entire country will go up in smoke. A whole nation high. Can you imagine the ramifications this will have? There will be no fighting, no war, no NIGS, no control. We'll have won. GRASSROOTS will have won!"
%
I put the cube back into the pouch. I knew what I had to do.
%
The night was dank. Flickering headlamps cut through the haze in the back alleys of St. Dylansburg as a lone auto-spliff cruised silently.
%
The driver wrinkled his nose, smelling burning oil; the fuel processor was running low. He brought the spliff to a stop beside a dark alcove and dropped the kickstand, pulling his helmet from his head.
%
At least, the thought-cop had been led to believe it was a he - but now, watching from the cover of the shadows, the cop saw mauve locks cascading over the shoulders of the spliff driver. A woman! The thought-cop's eyes followed the descent of her hair, all the way down to the small of her back and the generous orbs of her seated behind.
%
"Curvy," he thought to himself. The shock of learning his quarry's true gender was throwing his concentration off. He needed to apprehend her before she entered the weed bar in that alcove and left him helpless to act. Popping a repression tab into his mouth, he let it dissolve on his tongue and smiled.
%
The spliff driver cocked her head, brushing a few strands back behind one ear. Then she spoke:
%
"Those shadows can't hide you from the light of free thought."
%
The thought-cop's heart leapt into his sternum. He jumped from his hiding spot just as the driver turned and let loose a blast from her modified Pacifier. The glass bullet and its concentrated THC payload missed the cop by scant inches, but he smelled its contrail, and recoiled as images of class equality and chill times assailed his senses. He'd been conditoned to retch at such obscenity; cramming a handful of tabs into his mouth, he barked a muffled "STOP!" and let loose a hail of bullets - real ones.
%
The female vaulted off of the spliff, her curvaceous form moving like art as she sailed over the gunfire and drpped into a crouch.
